1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?

 - new Dog("Fido", 4)
 - new Dog("Fido", 3)
 - new Dog("Alfie", 4)
 - new Arraylist<Dog>
 - new Comparator<Animal>()

3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?

The comparator constructor call is line 16 - Collections.sort(dogs, new Comparator<Animal>()

The class definition for the comparator is defined between the curly braces after the Comparator<Animal>();
